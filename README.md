- 👋 Hi, I’m Will Buckingham @waywardphilosopher
- 👀 This is ust a set of repositories for a bunch of small web projects that I am running using Jekyll / Hugo
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the intricacies of GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m a writer mainly, so these projects are mainly to support all that.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me over at willbuckingham.com, or else on twitter as @willbuckingham
